;INT 21 - DOS 2+ - "UNLINK" - DELETE FILE
;        AH = 41h
;        DS:DX -> ASCIZ filename (no wildcards, but see notes)
;        CL = attribute mask for deletion (server call only, see notes)
;Return: CF clear if successful
;            AX destroyed (DOS 3.3) AL seems to be drive of deleted file
;        CF set on error
;            AX = error code (02h,03h,05h) (see #01680 at AH=59h/BX=0000h)
;Notes:  (DOS 3.1+) wildcards are allowed if invoked via AX=5D00h, in which case
;          the filespec must be canonical (as returned by AH=60h), and only
;          files matching the attribute mask in CL are deleted
;        DR DOS 5.0-6.0 returns error code 03h if invoked via AX=5D00h; DR DOS
;          3.41 crashes if called via AX=5D00h with wildcards
;        DOS does not erase the file's data; it merely becomes inaccessible
;          because the FAT chain for the file is cleared
;        deleting a file which is currently open may lead to filesystem
;          corruption.  Unless SHARE is loaded, DOS does not close the handles
;          referencing the deleted file, thus allowing writes to a nonexistant
;          file.
;        under DR DOS and DR Multiuser DOS, this function will fail if the file
;          is currently open
;        under the FlashTek X-32 DOS extender, the pointer is in DS:EDX
;BUG:    DR DOS 3.41 crashes if called via AX=5D00h
